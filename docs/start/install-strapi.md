title: Install Strapi
---

## Installation

To install the latest stable release with npm via the command-line tool:

```bash
$ npm install strapi-cli -g
```

Depending on the permissions on your machine you might need to run the installation as an administrator using `sudo`:

```bash
$ sudo npm install strapi-cli -g
```

## Verify the installation

Before creating a new project, let's verify the Strapi installation with:

```bash
$ strapi -v
2.0.0
```

If the command doesn't print a version but an error, the installation failed.

If you don't encounter any error you now are able to start using Strapi.
