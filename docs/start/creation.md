title: Create a project

Before you start: make sure you've installed the Strapi node module-- it should only take a minute!

## Create a project

First, we need to create a directory to hold your application:

```bash
$ strapi new appName
```

## Start your application

To run the server, make that your working directory and simply start your application:

```bash
$ cd appName
$ strapi start
```

The default home page is accessible at [http://localhost:1337/](http://localhost:1337/).
